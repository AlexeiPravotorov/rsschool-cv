I am 25 years old. I have been working at the Mozyr Oil Refinery since 2020. I work as a plant operator. I decided to discover something new and interesting, so I decided to study FRONT-END development.
I hope to gain knowledge in the field of front-end development and become a sought-after specialist. I will make every effort to study the necessary material.
